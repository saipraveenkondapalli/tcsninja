'''Airport security officials have confiscated several item of the passengers at the security check point. All the items have been dumped into a huge box (array). Each item possesses a certain amount of risk[0,1,2]. Here, the risk severity of the items represent an array[] of N number of integer values. The task here is to sort the items based on their levels of risk in the array. The risk values range from 0 to 2.


Example :

Input :

7  -> Value of N

[1,0,2,0,1,0,2]-> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by new line.


Output :

0 0 0 1 1 2 2  -> Element after sorting based on risk severity 


Example 2:

input : 10  -> Value of N 

[2,1,0,2,1,0,0,1,2,0] -> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by a new line.


Output : 

0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2  ->Elements after sorting based on risk severity.


Explanation:

In the above example, the input is an array of size N consisting of only 0’s, 1’s and 2s. The output is a sorted array from 0 to 2 based on risk severity. ''''
